# kaggle-cats-and-dogs
Train ResNet-18 CNN to perform binary classification on the [cats-and-dogs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tongpython/cat-and-dog) from Kaggle. 

## Description
A ResNet-18 which is pretrained on the ImageNet dataset is used to classify between cats and dogs. The trained model is used to generate a saliency map which represents the "implicit attention" of the CNN. The details of how to generate saliency map is introduced in the paper [Deep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualising Image Classification Models and Saliency Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6034). To visualize the saliency map to make it more explainatory to human, it is smoothed by a Gaussian filter so that it looks like a "heatmap". Below is an example of an image with its saliency map and heatmap:

## Dependencies
* Python 3.6.8
* Numpy 1.16.2
* Pytorch 1.0.1 (GPU version)
* Matplotlib 3.0.3
* Torchvision 0.2.1
* Scikit-learn 0.20.3
* Scipy 1.2.1

## Files
* dataset_statistics.py: calculate the mean and standard deviation of the dataset.
* helper.py: miscllaneous functions.
* post_process.py: read the result generated by transfer_learning_cnn_cv.py and plot the ROC curve for 10-fold cross-validation.
* saliency_visual.py: visualize the saliency map and heatmap as the example image.
* transfer_learning_cnn.py: train cnn in the train-val manner.
* transfer_learning_cnn_cv.py: cross validation for the neural network.
* utils.py: functions and classes to train the neural network.

## Usage
### 1-fold training
* To make sure that the code works, arrange data in the following manner:  
```
root/train/cat/
root/train/dog/
root/val/cat/
root/val/dog/
```
* To train the neural network:  
```
python transfer_learning_cnn.py -op cat_vs_dog -data_dir path_to_data -model_dir path_to_save_model -batch_size 256
```

### 5-fold cross-validation
* To make sure that the code works, arrange the data in the following manner:  
```
root/cv1/train/cat/
root/cv1/train/dog/
root/cv1/val/cat/
root/cv1/val/dog/
root/cv2/train/cat/
root/cv2/train/dog/
root/cv2/val/cat/
root/cv2/val/dog/
...
```
* To run cross-validation:  
```
python transfer_learning_cnn_cv.py -op cat_vs_dog -data_dir path_to_data -batch_size 256
```

* To see the results of cross-validation:  
```
python post_procees.py -op cat_vs_dog
```

### Visualize saliency map and heatmap
* First, make sure that 1-fold training is performed and the trained model is saved to *path_to_model*.
* Visualize an image with index 0:  
```
python saliency_visual.py -index 0 -op cat_vs_dog -data_dir path_to_data -model_dir path_to_model
```
